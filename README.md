# 21-Card-Game: <a href="https://21cardgame.netlify.app">Live Site</a></h1>

## How It's Made:
<p> I wanted to create a card game using the deck of cards api. So I decided to create a card game of 21. The first person that gets 21 wins. If no one gets 21 the person with the highest score that is not greater than 21 wins.</p>

## Optimizations:

<p> When I improve this project, I would like to add a hit and stay option so if the player does not have 21 they can hit or if they are close to 21 like 20 they can stay. </p>

## Lessons Learned:

<p> I learned what API's are and how to I can use and incroperate API's when creating websites.  </p>
